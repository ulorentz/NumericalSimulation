# NumericalSimulation
Simulations and exercises for the course "Numerical Simulation Laboratory" at the University of Milan.
## Instructions
In every folder there is of a `makefile` and a `run.sh` or a `README.txt`. In the first case just run `make` and then `./run.sh`, in the second case read the readmewhere there should be more specific instructions. Note that exercise 4, 6, and 7 are computationally intense.
I have run exercises 11 and 12 on a pc with a GPU, I suspect that on a CPU may be quite heavy.
