# NumericalSimulation
Simulations and exercises for the course "Numerical Simulation Laboratory" at the University of Milan.
## Instructions
Compiling and running the exercises is simple: just execute `make` in the main folder and then `run.sh`.
After that, you can visualize all the results opening the notebooks placed in each excercise's folder. In the beginning of each notebook instructions for the current exercise are given: sometimes (e.g. ex5) different running options from the default are available. 
Note: exercise04 is not run with the general `run.sh` due to being computational heavy. Go into the exercise04 folder and read `README.txt` for further instructions.
